          <h2>The Noble Queen of the Maratha Empire</h2>
          <p>
            Ahilyabai was born on 31 May 1725 in the village of Chaundi, 
            in the present-day Ahmednagar district in Maharashtra. 
            Her father, Mankoji Sindhia (Shinde), a scion of a respectable Dhangar family 
            residing at Chonde of the Beed district, was the Patil of that Village.
             Women then did not go to school, but Ahilyabai's father taught her to read and write.

            Her entrance onto the stage of history was something of an accident: Malhar Rao Holkar, 
            a commander in the service of the Maratha Peshwa Baji Rao I and lord of the Malwa territory, stopped in 
            Chaundi on his way to Pune and, according to legend, saw the eight-year-old Ahilyabai at the temple service in the village. 
            Recognising her piety and her character, Shrimant Peshwa adviced Malharrao holkar to select the girl as a bride for his son, Khanderao (1723–1754).
            She married Khanderao Holkar in 1733 and gave birth to their son Malerao and daughter Muktabai in 1745 and 1748, respectively.
            Malerao was mentally ill and died in 1767 as a result of his disease. Breaking another tradition, Ahilyabai married her daughter to Yashwantrao, 
            a brave but poor man, after he had succeeded in defeating dacoits

          <h3>Views about her</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              "Ahilyabai's extraordinary ability won her the regard of her subjects and of the other Maratha confederates, 
              including Nana Phadnavis. With the natives of Malwa ... her name is sainted and she has styled an avatar or Incarnation of the
              Divinity.
               In the soberest view that can be taken of her character, she certainly appears, within her limited sphere,
               to have been one of the purest and most exemplary rulers that ever existed."<br>— John Malcolm, A Memoir of Central India</br>
            </li>
            <li>
              "From the original papers and letters, it becomes clear that she was the 
              first-class politician, and that was why she readily extended her support to Mahadji Shinde. I have no hesitation in saying that without the support of Ahilyabai, 
              Mahadji would never have gained so much importance in the politics of northern India."<br>— Historian Judunath Sarkar
            </li>
            <li>
              "The Great Maratha lady who affords the noblest example of wisdom, goodness, and virtue.
               Akbar is among male sovereigns, and Ahilyabai is among female sovereigns".
               <br>        — An English writer quoted in the book Ahilya Bai Holkar by Khadpekar
            </li>
            <li>
              "It reveals beyond doubt that all ideal virtues described by Plato and Bhattacharya were present in her personalities like Dilip, 
              Janak, Shri Ram, Shri Krishna, and Yudhishthir. After thorough scrutiny of the long history of the world, we find only
               one personality of Lokmata Devi Ahilya that represents an absolutely ideal ruler."
               <br>— Arvind Javlekar
